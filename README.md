# numberGuessingGame

Objective of game: User tries to guess the number that has been radomly generated within 3 guesses. 

This game was originally a game created in my Intro to C++ class (CS10A) for one player to play. 

To review the concepts learned from the class this quarter and implement new concepts, I decided to take this game and add a 2 player feature so users can play this game with friends as well.
